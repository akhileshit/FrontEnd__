Some more Pseudo-Classes in CSS:
- :nth-child(n)      select nth child of parent element
- :nth-of-type(n)      select nth child of specified type
- :nth-last-child(n)        select last child of parent element
- :nth-last-of-type(n)    select last child of specified type
- :only-child      
- :first-child
- :last-child
- :not(selector)      select all ele that donot match specified selector
- :active         styles an ele when it is activated (link/button clicked&hold)
- :visited      styles links already visited

- (n)   accepts number,keyword,formula like(2, 5, 2n, 2+3, odd, even,...) 
- CATCH here is :      'space' makes difference in all of pseudo-classes which selects using position        (nth-child(), nth-of-type(), nth-last-child(), only-child, first-child, also not(),.....)
- ex1: div :nth-child(2) ---> div's 2nd child   (with space)
- ex2: div:nth-of-type(2) ---> div as 2nd child  (w/o space)      crazy right?!!!

Box-Model :       Very important Concept in CSS
  Height&Width of the content
  Padding        internal space b/w content and border
  Border 
  Margin        separates b/w elements or body/document & elements. it is used create breathing-room b/w elements 

- These 4 components makes the box Model
- To see it in the browser for any website or your code, right click on the element you want to see the box-model for and 'inspect' or else you'll get wrong elements box-model or the body/documents box-model !!  BE CAREFUL


    height: 40px;
    width: 60px;

    /* padding-top: 20px;
    padding-right: 25px;
    padding-bottom: 35px;
    padding-left: 50px; */
                                (or)

    padding: 20px 25px 35px 50px;    /* like "clockwise" -----top-right-bottom-left------ */

    /* padding: 20px; */      /* all sides 20px */
    /* padding: 20px 25px; */      /* top&bottom 20px, right&left 25px */
    /* padding: 20px 25px 35px; */      /* top 20px, right&left 25px, bottom 35px */

    /* ///ly like padding for margin */
    margin: 20px 35px 45px 60px;

    border: 25px solid red;

- padding and margin can for all 4 sides can be written with 4 properties (or) 1 property!! only
- margin can have negative value but padding cannot (think logically)
- look at this box model in browser by inspecting or using developer tools, it looks beautifully with our customized properties like margin, border, padding & height&width

- if you  anytime get stuck or frustrated by the misalignment of your elements Remember box model and use it to crack it........
