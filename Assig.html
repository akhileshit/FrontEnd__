		<h1>OOPS</h1>
		<p> Ever wonder how to "do" object oriented programming (OOP)?
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is all too often viewed by those unfamiliar to it as a science to be mastered.  OOP however, is an art...a methodology, a simple (but powerful) way of defining what a program is.  After going through many tutorials on the subject some of us still scratched our heads and lamented, "Interesting philosophy, but I still don't know how to do OOP."  We wanted to master a science and we couldn't find the telltale step-by-step instructions we were looking for.  So, I've written this article to save you that frustration.<p>
		<h2> Building Blocks: </h2>
		<h3> <mark>POLYMORPHISM</mark> </h3>
		<p> <b>Polymorphism</b>, meaning "many forms," is a core tenet of object-oriented programming (OOP) where objects can take on different forms37. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type3. Polymorphism enables code reusability, simplifies complex systems, and supports modular architectures2. There are typically two types: compile-time (static) and run-time (dynamic)1. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method and operator overloading, while run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and interfaces1. Polymorphism enhances <mark><em>flexibility</em></mark> and <mark><em>maintainability</em></mark> in software development27.
</p>
		<h3> <mark>INHERITANCE</mark> </h3>
		<p> In object-oriented programming (OOP), <b>Inheritance</b> is a mechanism where a class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class1. It allows creating new classes (derived or child classes) from existing ones (base or parent classes), forming a hierarchy13. The derived class inherits features of the base class and can add new ones or override existing ones1. Inheritance promotes code <mark><i>reusability</i></mark> and reduces redundancy, making code more efficient and maintainable12. It models real-world relationships, like a 'Car' being a type of 'Vehicle'2. Inheritance also provides a framework for polymorphism2
</p>
		<h3> <mark>ABSTRACTION</mark> </h3>
		<p> In object-oriented programming (OOP), <b>Abstraction</b> simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary implementation details and showing only essential information123. It allows focusing on an object's key features and behaviors, improving code maintainability and reusability1. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces15. For example, when using an ATM, a user only needs to enter their PIN to withdraw cash; the complex backend processes are hidden2. By exposing only necessary properties and methods, abstraction makes code easier to understand and work with3. Data abstraction hides internal data implementation, providing a <mark><strong>simplified view</strong></mark> for users3.
</p>
		<h3> <mark>ENCAPSULATION</mark> </h3>
		<p> In object-oriented programming (OOP), <b>Encapsulation</b> is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, often a class1345. It <mark><u>restricts</u></mark> direct access to some of an object's components, thus hiding the implementation details1. Encapsulation helps in preventing unintended interference and misuse of data4. Access to the data is typically managed through publicly accessible methods (getters and setters)367. This ensures data integrity and prevents <mark><strike>unauthorized</strike></mark> access, contributing to a more secure and well-structured codebase34. Encapsulation is one of the four essential principles of OOP, along with inheritance, <mark><small>polymorphism</small></mark>, and <mark><big>abstraction37</big></mark>.
